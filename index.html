            <h4>The issues with AI</h4>
            <p>The main issue is how information can be manipulated and ultimately control our behavior without us being aware of it. 
                Information available will influence how we are and view the world. The internet created an opportunity to share information and get 
                in touch with other people with the same or different opinions. 
                Information is vital, and if manipulated, can be used to control. This is 
                for instance the situation in many countries with 
                authoritarian leaders, such as China or North-Korea where information 
                is censored, and people are constantly fed with propaganda. Any sign of any 
                opposition will lead to prosecution. </p>
                
                <h5>Advancements</h5>
                <p>Artificial intelligence has become so advanced 
                    that it can generate text and images within seconds, and it is not always easy for us to differentiate what is real 
                    and what is artificially made. Fake news can affect a society in many ways. For instance, it can cause polarization of a society 
                    regarding political, social, ideological, and religious issues. Fake news can be made to cause harm and manipulate a society. For instance, anti-vaccinators 
                    influencing people to not vaccinate their children affect the herd immunity in their society. Fake news can lead to individual harm as well as collective harm. 
                    People’s perception of reality is affected, and it can cause a problem when facts and the truth matter less than opinions and beliefs. Fake news has been challenging to 
                    control because it spreads fast and gets amplified, reaching millions within minutes. Enforcing laws to control it has been challenging because it also affects other rights. 
                    As future developers, it is important for us to be aware of this issue so we can identify the problems surrounding this topic and find solutions. It is more likely that society will 
                    utilize AI in many ways, and we must be aware of how to process information, be able to know how to fact-check and verify whether the information is true or not. </p>
